3 PROGRESS POINTS A WEEK TOWARDS THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE -> Create an AI assisted Quantum Correction Algorithm which is respresented through Music

Each month is broken into 4 sections with the remainder of the month set for reflection and analysis (minimum of 3 updates each week)
1-6   -> Section 1
7-13  -> Section 2
13-19 -> Section 3
19-25 -> Section 4


---Section 3---1
01/16/25_1	downloaded qsim to start analyzing and learning quantum simulations, also set up python to begin further manipulation
01/17/25_2	set up grok to teach me in a very effective manner (a bit of info, review question then more info), set up public posts to document progress
01/19/25_3	learned about Determinism, Probailism, and Superposition and created a post on it

---Section 4---1
01/22/25_1	learned about the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and created a post on it
01/23/25_2	did a lesson on why entanglement happens (still not sure on the details, will need to continue to research)
01/24/25_3	working on the Basics of Quantum Information course by IBM (can get an online badge at the end of it!)

---Section 1---2
02/03/25_1	learned about Topological Quantum Computing (the most theoretical current model, based on Majorana Zero-Mode Quasi-Particles? asked Grok for more info, a type of 'antiparticle' which means if they meet each they annihilate each other completely, not sure on usefulness)



SIDE PROJECT -> Quantum Qubit

01/26/25_1	going to create a crypto called Quantum Qubit with a faucet website attached to it (gives random amounts at random increments)
01/27/25_2	set up basic contract and lined up the software needed, learned how to configure some of the variables
01/28/25_3	designed basic idea for the crypto release schedule (start with 4096 over 8 months, then halved every 8 months, low amount could lead to a high per token price), was able to compile new smart contract that has more functionality
01/29/25_4	created list of need to dos
02/03/25_5	still working on the contract and the plan for the website (could just use Gamerah.ai or buy a new URL)


NEED TO DO
design simple website (probaby just reuse gamerah.ai or buy quantumqubit.x)
set up function for taking user guesses
set up system to make it available at an increment that matches the crypto
set up way of giving out crypto based on guesses
need to find the software and hosting that will accommodate this
user will be "authenticated" through session token and wallet address (meta mask?)
